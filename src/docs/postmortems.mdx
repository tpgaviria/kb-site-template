PagerDuty Postmortems allow users to learn from major incidents by providing a summary of events that transpired, how the response was handled, and what resolution steps were taken. It offers the ability to curate a timeline of activity in PagerDuty and Slack, allowing further analysis to determine follow-up actions for similar situations in the future and, ideally, help prevent them altogether. 
> PagerDuty Postmortems is available for accounts on our Digital Operations plan and as part of the [Modern Incident Response](https://support.pagerduty.com/v1/docs/pagerduty-modern-incident-response) package. If you are interested in getting on a pricing plan that includes PagerDuty Postmortems, please feel free to [contact us](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/) for more information."

### Creating a Postmortem
> #### Required User Permissions
> Observers, Limited Users, Users, Admins and Account Owners (or their respective [advanced permission base roles](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/advanced-permissions#section--migrating-from-basic-to-advanced-permission-roles-)) can create, modify and delete postmortems .",

Postmortems can be created either from the **Postmortems** catalog or directly from a resolved incident.

From the Postmortems catalog (found in the **Analytics** menu of the PagerDuty web app), you can either create a new postmortem or edit an existing one.

To create a new postmortem, select **New Report**. You’ll then be prompted to give your report a name, designate an **owner** of the review process and define the time range during which your incident occurred. Keep in mind that, although multiple people may have been involved in the incident’s response, there can only be a single owner of any one postmortem.

Once you have designated an owner and specified a time range, select **Create Report** to get started adding contextual data.

You can also create your postmortem directly from a resolved incident using the **New Postmortem Report** button on that incident's details page. This automatically fills in the incident's description as the postmortem's title and will also fill in the triggered and resolved times for the incident as the start and end times for the report. All of these fields can be edited at any point during this process.

##Adding Data Sources
To link incidents to this postmortem, enter their **incident numbers** (one at a time) and select **Associate Incident**. If you’d like to include discussions from public Slack channels, you can do so by clicking the **Connect to Slack** button. Once you’ve authorized PagerDuty to access your Slack account, you will then be prompted to select channels or rooms to include in your report.

Postmortem Builder will, by default, make available all chat messages sent and incident log entries created on the associated incidents during the time period specified in this section. You will have the opportunity later to choose which activity you’d like to include in the postmortem’s timeline.

> To include **Slack** content in a postmortem, a contributor must authorize PagerDuty to access Slack on their behalf, which will let that contributor see Slack content in the **Available Data** listing. Each PagerDuty user will need to authorize with Slack individually. \n\nIf your Slack user account does not have permissions to add apps to your team, you will need to first ask a Slack admin to go to Slack's App Directory and authorize the [PagerDuty Postmortems app](https://pagerduty.slack.com/apps/A51BZ1FCG-pagerduty-postmortems)."

## Creating your Timeline
Select the entries from your **Available Data** to include in your timeline by hovering over their source icons and using the **+** button. You can also add multiple items at once by selecting them while holding the **shift** key and then using the **>** button to move them to the timeline. You can manually add freeform entries to your timeline by selecting **New Timeline Entry**.

Any Slack entries that are moved from the **Available Data** listing into the postmortem's **Timeline** will be visible to anyone looking at the postmortem.

## Analysis
This section allows you to summarize and reflect on the curated timeline, including incident root cause analysis and potential steps to prevent or mitigate future incidents.

The postmortem builder comes with a default template for analysis to get you started, but you can add, edit or delete the fields that users see by editing the **Report Template** in the **Settings** tab, accessible from the main postmortems catalog.

## Saving your Postmortem
Postmortems need to be saved to keep the postmortem content stored. When you are done editing your postmortem, select **Save and View Report** from the bottom of the Postmortem Builder to save the data.

### Exporting your Postmortem
Once you have completed your postmortem report, you can export it as a PDF by viewing it and using the **Save as PDF** button.

### Customize Postmortem Template

#### Why should I customize my Report Template?

The purpose of the postmortem process is to learn how to improve both system resiliency and the response process. As you learn new insights, you could customize your report and add or remove sections that apply to your team's specific use case.

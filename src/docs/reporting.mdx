### Advanced Reporting

Advanced Reporting is available on Business and Digital Operations plans. Please [contact our Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/) if you would like to upgrade to a plan featuring Advanced Reporting. In addition to [Basic Reporting](#section-basic-reporting), these accounts include the following reports, found under the **Analytics** menu:

- [System Report](/docs/analytics#section-system-report)
- [Team Report](/docs/analytics#section-team-report)
- [User Report](/docs/analytics#section-user-report)

User, Team, and System reports use the account-level time zone for filtering and display. The account-level time zone is also used for drilldowns.

Incident .csv exports for Advanced Reporting reports include timestamps in the account-level time zone. 

If a Team organization filter is applied when viewing advanced reporting, reports will display data for the Team filtered, and the reported incidents will be filtered to reflect the escalation policies on that team.
> ### Note
> The CSV is currently limited to a maximum of 20,000 records. After 20,000 rows, the export will be truncated, so if your CSV contains exactly 20,000 rows, you may have partial data.",

## System Report

The system report provides an overview of your account by escalation policies and services.

Incidents created prior to May 2013 do not have an escalation policy ID associated with them, and will not be visible within the system report when filtering by escalation policy. However, you can still view these incidents by service.

### Parameters
Set the data rollup period by selecting **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**. Filter by date range. The date filters will filter incidents according to when the incident was created. 

Data may be sorted by either *service* or *escalation policy*.

You can review data by the:
- Number of High-Urgency Incidents
- Mean Time to Acknowledge High-Urgency Incidents
- Median Time to Acknowledge High-Urgency Incidents
- 90th Percentile Time to Acknowledge High-Urgency Incidents
- Mean Time to Resolve High-Urgency Incidents
- Median Time to Resolve High-Urgency Incidents
- 90th Percentile time to Resolve High-Urgency Incidents

Set the data rollup period by selecting **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**. Filter by date range. The date filters will filter incidents according to when the incident was created.

## User Report
User reporting provides detailed information about individual responders in PagerDuty. Only users who have been assigned at least one incident will appear in User reports.

### Parameters
Filter by date range. The date filters will filter incidents according to when the incident was created.


Percentages are calculated by dividing the action—such as acknowledging an incident—by the total number of incidents assigned to a user.

\**Time on call is not recorded when users are placed directly on an escalation policy level outside of a schedule. If a user is concurrently on-call on two schedules, that time is not counted twice. Please note that Time on Call data was not recorded before 12:00 AM (UTC), October 31st, 2015.* 
### Basic Reporting"
Basic reporting is offered on any level of PagerDuty plan. There are two reports found under the **Analytics** menu:
- [Notification Volume](#section-notifications-report)
- [Incident Volume](#section-incidents-report)

Visit the [Data Export](#section-data-export) section to read about exporting reports. 

Incident and Notification reports in Basic Reporting use the user's configured time zone for filtering and display. Incident .csv exports include timestamps in the account-level time zone. Notification exports include timestamps in UTC.
> #### Note
